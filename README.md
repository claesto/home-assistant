## Equipment

Home Assistant is running on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with an [60GB Kingston SSD](https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-SSDNow-SV300S37A-60G/dp/B00A35X6GM). I used [this guide](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/installing-home-assistant-on-a-rpi-4b-with-ssd-boot/230948) by *JÃ¶rg Wagner* to migrate my setup from an SD card to the SSD.

I used the Hassio installation method. Plans exist to migrate to a more powerful setup, because as of right now I have the Pi 4 running Home Assistant and a separate Pi 3b+ running docker containers. Migrating both Pi's to a single machine with docker might make things *easier*.

## Automations

1. Notify me when to take out the trash, before the collection of the day after
2. Notify me whenever [Meteo Alarm](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/meteoalarm/) issues a warning for Antwerp (Belgium)
3. Turn on lights in storage room, or toilet, after motion is detected and lux < 60; turn off lights after 20 seconds, toilet after 120 seconds
4. Fade-in bedside lights in the morning as a more *natural* wake up process instead of an alarm
5. Turn on floor lamp in the living room at sunset
6. Turn on outside lights 20 minutes after sunset; turn off at 10PM, and activate them on based on motion

Besides these, there are also *security-based* notifications, related to motion detections when no one is in the house. I can't list all automations, as they frequently change, are removed or new ones are added.

## Dashboards

Work in progress. I currently use the [Kibibit theme](https://github.com/Kibibit/hass-kibibit-theme) with additionally [Hass Hue Icons](https://github.com/arallsopp/hass-hue-icons), [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card), [auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities) and [animated weather card theme](https://github.com/wowgamr/animated-weather-card).

I have *divided* Home Assistant into two *views*: an overview of devices, sensors, metrics per room. On the second dashboard, everything is grouped by *type*.
