Over time, I\u2019ve developed a set of automations that help streamline my daily routines, enhance convenience, and add an extra layer of security to my home. At the moment, I\u2019ve organized my automations into three main categories:</p> <ol> <li>Lighting: Automating lights based on motion, presence, or time of day to create an efficient, comfortable living environment.</li> <li>Alarm &amp; Security: Setting up motion sensors, door/window sensors, and presence detection to ensure my home stays secure at all times.</li> <li>Notifications: Sending alerts for important events like security breaches, maintenance reminders, or unexpected changes in my system.</li> </ol> <p>These automations have evolved over time, and I\u2019m always looking for new ways to enhance their functionality.
