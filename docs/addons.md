# Add-ons
## Introduction
Add-ons enhance Home Assistantâ€™s functionality by enabling the installation of additional applications. These applications may integrate with Home Assistant, or facilitate tasks like sharing configurations via Samba for seamless editing from other devices.

Add-ons are in fact [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) managed from within Home Assistant. If you've installed "Home Assistant" as the OS,the add-on store allows you to install these. If you've installed Home Assistant within Docker, you're supposed to setup & manage these containers yourself.

## Integrations versus add-ons
In Home Assistant, **integrations** and **add-ons** serve distinct purposes and operate in different parts of the system. See [my integrations](integrations.md).

### Key differences
