# My Home Assistant setup

I strive to share my best tips for Home Assistant here, along with my configuration.

I'm a **scrum master** in Belgium. With a background as a developer, I have a strong passion for IoT and smart home technologies, particularly [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io). Outside of work, I enjoy playing padel.

Start by exploring [My smart home](smarthome.md "My smart home journey") for the full journey, or jump directly to my Home Assistant [integrations](integrations.md "Home Assistant integrations"), the [add-ons](addons.md "Home Assistant add-ons") I use, the [automations](automations.md "Home Assistant automations") or the [dashboards](lovelace.md "Home Assistant dashboards") I've built.

!!! info "Updates"

    I update this documentation regularly, but some information may occasionally be outdated.
